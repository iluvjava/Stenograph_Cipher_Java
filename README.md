# Stenograph_Cipher_Java
Let's hide something into media file just for fun, totally not for secrecy, privacy protection, tracking my files with water marks or shit like that. 

# Plan 
* 3 ways to hide information inside the images. 
    ** Pertubating the Discrete Cosine Transform Coefficient for Lossy Compressed images. 
    ** Pertubating the bitmap value representing the color by a small amount. 
    ** Using Pseudo Black and white, and hide by pertubating different layers of the RBG values. 

* Ways to encryp images: 
    ** Cryptographic Sudo-random + Seed 
    ** RSA symmetric encryption scheme
